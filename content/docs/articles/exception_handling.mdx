title: No exception handling?

# No exception handling?

While we support the `Try` part in try/catch, we do not support `Catch` for multiple reasons:

1. To support try and catch, we would need an error stack that could extends to arbitrary depth. However, for the following reasons,
we decided to use a fixed amount of memory for the error stack:
    * **Safety**
    * Reduce complexity of our implementation
2. C doesn't have exceptions handling, so adding catch would force users to learn a new way to write C, which is bad and makes our library over-complicated for users.
3. You may be tempted to use `ctb_clear_error()` to do exceptions catching. It could be dangerous 
if you have some previous errors that you forgot to handle, especially when we are not a language-level framework
to enforce error checking and exiting.
